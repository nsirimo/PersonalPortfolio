            <p>
                Currently a junior attending California State University Los Angeles studying computer science. Starting my career in software testing,
                I really developed a mindset for quality test driven
                software during my time and got inspired to pursue higher learning! After that I moved into software web development at the same company and continue to learn everyday.
